## Problem Statement

Tracking data across different services and tracking acknowledgement across multiple clients is hard. I wanted to have a single dashboard where I can see all the messages (tracked by a unique `message_id`) and all events emitted by each message during different stages in it's lifecycle.

The events are processed as mentioned in Event Engine flow ðŸ‘‡ below. You can track the life cycle of your data based on the missing events.

## Event Engine flow

Event engine has 3 pipelines

* EventCollector
* EventAggregator
* EventStore

**EventCollector**

Event Collector is a FIFO Queue to receive all events from HTTP End points or External message brokers to put into our FIFO Queue inside Elixir's GenStage.

We create 10 EventCollectors during application start.

**EventAggregator**

Event Aggregator GenStage will periodically poll *EventCollector* with a pre-defined batch size to get events from the FIFO Queue and aggregate it by a unique message ID. 

For eg., in a batch of 10, say message ID `a` has 3 events all of them will be batched together and made as a single entry with array of events as it's value. 

We create 10 EventAggregators which will be subscribed to one EventCollector each.

**EventStore**

Event Store stores events into a persistent storage. It will do an upsert based on the unique messageID. 

We create 10 EventStores for each EventCollector instance, so as to parallelize storage layer.

## Websockets

We have a thin websocket layer to show updates to a messageId in real time. Messages to Websockets are emitted during *EventStore*. 

## Event Structure

Sample single event payload

```json
{
  "app_id": "<string>",
  "message_id": "<string>",
  "event": "<string>",
  "created_at": "<utc_timestamp>"
}
```

Sample bulk event payload

```json
{
  "events": [{
    "app_id": "<string>",
    "message_id": "<string>",
    "event": "<string>",
    "created_at": "<utc_timestamp>"
  }]
}
```

### Http Endpoints

Expose HTTP End points `/api/create_event` to trigger events from external systems.

*TODO*: Add support for Message brokers.

## For testing in dev environment

https://localhost:4001/api/create_event - End point to generate random events for test

https://localhost:4001/api/test_socket?message_id=5250000 - End point to generate random events for a messageId to test if it appears through websockets

https://localhost:4001/status - Service health check

https://localhost:4001/api/q/stats - Queue statistics page

## Stress testing

You can set the number of events created during each time we hit https://localhost:4001/api/create_event in the `event_controller.ex`

I've used `wrk` to generate load.

Run `mars` in prod mode `MIX_ENV=prod mix phx.server`

Sample `wrk` command

`wrk -t1 -c1 -d10s http://localhost:4000/api/create_event`

**Sample result**

```
wrk -t20 -c20 -d10s http://localhost:4000/api/create_event
Running 10s test @ http://localhost:4000/api/create_event
  20 threads and 20 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
    Latency     2.29ms    2.70ms  60.49ms   94.22%
    Req/Sec   517.54     81.16     1.04k    73.65%
  103177 requests in 10.02s, 22.85MB read
Requests/sec:  10293.71
Transfer/sec:      2.28MB
```

It's over **9000** 	`\( ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)/`

*Note*: I got around >9k req/s for a couple of times. Most other times ~8k req/s +/- 500 req/s seemed fine for my use case :) Don't take benchmarks seriously. Also it wasn't benchmarked in Cloud. Done from my MBP.

## Installation steps

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
