## Problem Statement

Tracking data across different data stores and deliverability across multiple clients is hard. I wanted to have a single dashboard where I can see all the messages (tracked by a unique `message_id`) and all events emitted by each of the message in it's lifecycle. 

The events are processed as mentioned in Event Engine flow ðŸ‘‡ below. You can track the life cycle of your data based on the missing events.

## Event Engine flow

This has an Event engine with 3 pipelines

```
EventCollector
EventAggregator
EventStore
```

**EventCollector**

Event Collector will be a FIFO Queue to receive all events from HTTP End points/External message brokers to put into our FIFO Queue inside Elixir's GenStage.

**EventAggregator**

Event Aggregator GenStage will periodically poll *EventCollector* with a pre-defined batch size to get events from the FIFO Queue and aggregate it by a unique message ID. 

For eg., in a batch of 10, say message ID `a` has 3 events all of them will be batched together and made as a single event. 

**EventStore**

Event Store, stores events into a persistent storage. It will do an upsert based on the unique messageID. 

## Event Structure

Sample event payload

```
%{
  app_id: <string>,
  message_id: <string>,
  event: <string>,
  created_at: <utc_timestamp>
}
```

### Http Endpoints

Expose HTTP End points `/api/create_event` to trigger events from external systems.

*TODO*: Add support for Message brokers later

## For testing in dev environment

https://localhost:4001/api/create_event - End point to generate test random events

https://localhost:4001/status - Service health check

https://localhost:4001/api/q/stats - Queue statistics page

## Stress testing

You can set the number of events created during each time we hit https://localhost:4001/api/create_event in the `event_controller.ex`

I've used `wrk` to generate load.

Sample command

`wrk -t20 -c20 -d10s https://localhost:4001/api/create_event`

Sample result

```
wrk -t20 -c20 -d10s https://localhost:4001/api/create_event

## Installation steps

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
